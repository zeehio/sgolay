Description: Efficient Savitzky-Golay filtering for real vectors. This package
 implements one dimensional Savitzky-Golay filters that can be applied to
 vectors and matrices (either row-wise or column-wise). Vectorization and memory
 allocations have been profiled to reduce computational fingerprint. Short filter
 lengths are implemented in the direct space, while longer filters are implemented
 in frequency space, using FFT.
