Description: Smoothing signals and computing their derivatives is a common
 requirement in signal processing workflows. Savitzky-Golay filters are a
 established method able to do both (Savitzky and Golay, 1964 <doi: 10.1021/ac60214a047>).
 This package implements one dimensional Savitzky-Golay filters that can be applied to
 vectors and matrices (either row-wise or column-wise).
 Vectorization and memory allocations have been profiled to reduce computational
 fingerprint. Short filter lengths are implemented in the direct space, while
 longer filters are implemented in frequency space, using a Fast Fourier
 Transform (FFT).
